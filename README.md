This is a very simple plugin that allows you to combine an elytra with a chest plate in a smithing table (or an anvil, if configured).

The result will be an armored elytra.
Armored elytras offer the same amount of protection as a diamond chest plate and they can have the same enchantments as well. This means that you can add protection, fire protection etc to the armored elytra as well.

By default, you can only see the elytra when a player wears an armored elytra. However, you will be able to see both the armor and the elytra at the same time if you install THIS Fabric mod on the client!

List of features:
- Combine an elytra with any type of chest plate armor to create an armored elytra! It will have the same amount of armor as the type of armor it was combined with!
- Supports enchantments.
- Configurable list of allowed enchantments (and curses).
- Configurable repair cost.
- Permissions for giving / wearing / crafting different tiers of armored elytras.
- Add enchantments using enchanted books.
- Receive notification when the plugin is out-of-date.
- Permissions support.
- Configurable messages, elytra names and elytra lores.
- Uninstaller for when you no longer want to use this plugin.
