## Upgrade note

- This update adds support for a new armor tier. This requires changes to existing locale files.<br>
  If you're using the default locale file, just delete the old one and let an up-to-date one be generated.<br>
  If you're using a custom locale file, you'll need to add the new entries manually.

## What's Changed

- Add support for Portuguese language and proper Readme in #29
- Add support for the `COPPER` armor tier on Minecraft 1.21.9+ in #30
