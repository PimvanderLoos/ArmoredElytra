## Upgrade note

- This update adds support for a new armor tier. This requires changes to existing locale files.<br>
  If you're using the default locale file, just delete the old one and let an up-to-date one be generated.<br>
  If you're using a custom locale file, you'll need to add the new entries manually.
- This version requires at least Java 17. As such, Minecraft 1.16 and 1.17 are no longer supported.

## What's Changed

- Add support for Portuguese language and proper Readme in #29
- Add support for the `COPPER` armor tier on Minecraft 1.21.9+ in #30
- Bump minimum Java version to 17 in #32
